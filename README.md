[DHT 11 Sensor] [!https://www.electronicwings.com/raspberry-pi/dht11-interfacing-with-raspberry-pi]              

1. Create a virtual environment (replace myenv with any name you prefer):
```python3 -m venv myenv ```

2.Activate the virtual environment:
```source myenv/bin/activate```

3.Install the required library inside the virtual environment:
```pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-dht```

4.Run your Python script within the virtual environment.
